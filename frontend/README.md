# RealDesigner 

## Building
Building the website can be done with the ./build.sh script. This builds it into the real-designer/dist folder.
This script will also build all npm dependencies. Refer to the angular-cli documentation for installing Angular2+ 

[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
